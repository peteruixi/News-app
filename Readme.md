##### **Overview**

News app is a tiny sample spring-boot project targeting towards services in news feed web application. Featuring basic operation in administrative services like privilage designation and user services like pulling up news articles and hitting likes.

   It is my attempt to understand and learn java spring-boot and web application development. In order to build this program, I took reference to the very educational open-source project [mall](https://github.com/macrozheng/mall-learning) by macroZhang. Hence, the package dependency and source code layout is fairly similar. 

**Enviroment**: 

OS: macOS Catalina ver.10.15.1
