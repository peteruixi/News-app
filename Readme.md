##### Overview

News app is a tiny sample spring-boot project targeting towards services in news feed web application. It is my attempt to understand and learn java spring-boot and web application development. In order to build this program, I took reference to the open-source project [mall](https://github.com/macrozheng/mall-learning) and it's very informative tutorial built by macroZhang. Hence, News app's structure was modeled after the the 'mall' project.
